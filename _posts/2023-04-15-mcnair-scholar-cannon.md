Cannon Cline, sophomore in Earth & Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell, was inducted into the [McNair Scholars Program](https://mcnairscholars.com/) today! The McNair Scholars Program is a federal program designed to prepare undergraduates for doctoral programs through involvement in research activities, and is aimed at diversifying the academy by focusing on first-generation students and students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. For his research project, Cannon will be working with the Srikrishnan Lab on understanding the risks posed by sea-level rise to coastal ecosystems. Congrats, Cannon!

Chloe Darnell took her M-Exam today and successfully defended her thesis, "Uncertainty in Emissions Pathways and Earth System Dynamics: Implications for Global Mean Sea Level Rise," despite the challenges of a building power outage. Chloe will graduate with her M.S. in Biological & Environmental Engineering in August before taking some well-deserved time off. Congrats, Chloe!
